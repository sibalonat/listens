## About Listens

Personal website with LARAVEL in the Backend and Vue in the Front.
It was made possible through the use of Inertia and Jetstream. 

- composer install
- artisan migrate
- npm install && npm run dev && npm run hot for continuos compiling with new changes. 
since the application uses Tailwind it needs the hot command.
